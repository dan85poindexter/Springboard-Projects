 Using data from the London Datastore
After consolidating (grouping) by borough, the percentage increase in average housing prices was calculated for the 10 year period ending in 2018. Two plots were constructed to provide comparison of increases between the top 15 boroughs seeing the largest percentage increases for the period, and the fifteen boroughs with the slowest growth.
